BinarySearchTree.BST Class
Overview:

The BST class represents a generic Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. It provides methods for inserting, retrieving, and deleting key-value pairs, as well as an iterator for in-order traversal to return elements in sorted order.
Constructors:

    BST(): Constructs an empty BST.

Methods:

    put(K key, V value): Inserts a key-value pair into the BST.

    get(K key): Retrieves the value associated with the specified key from the BST.

    delete(K key): Deletes the key-value pair associated with the specified key from the BST.

    iterator(): Returns an iterator for in-order traversal of the BST, which returns elements in sorted order.

Inner Class:

    Node: Represents a node in the BST, containing a key-value pair, and references to its left and right child nodes.

Example Usage:

java

BST<Integer, String> bst = new BST<>();
bst.put(5, "Five");
bst.put(3, "Three");
System.out.println(bst.get(5)); // Output: Five
bst.delete(3);
